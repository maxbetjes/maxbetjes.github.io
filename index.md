OrganoidTracker is a modular framework for 3D cell tracking that provides cell tracks and well-callibrated error probabilities associated with every step in these tracks. These error proabilities can be used to guide manual review or to filter the data enabling fully automated analysis. <br>
OrganoidTracker comes with a python bases GUI optimized for the curation of 3D cell tracking results. We currently have machine-learning models available trained on intestinal organoid data and c. Elegans embryos. The intestinal organoid trained models can track a wide range range of 3D tissues including blastocysts. <br>
We host a [Hugging Face space]({{site.hugging_face_website}}) where users can quickly test our models performance on their data.
